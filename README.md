# Python-API-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 6 HW on APIs
I found this assignment to be slightly challenging.  For the VacationPy I couldn't find a hotel within my parameters and limits within 10000 metres of the cities that did fit my preferences.  I was honestly surprised at that.  I changed the temperature range and wind speed twice and the results were still no hotels found.  

For the WeatherPy exercise, I found the Northern Hemisphere was a little more varied than the Southern Hemisphere.  The line regressions were more copy and paste once I got the first one plotted.

I did use the Xpert Learner and got some help from Prof. Booth in slack.
